Without Middlewares 
there is a client which sends the request to the server 
and there's the server which gets the request of the client and will route which part of the code it has to run and will send the desired response 


With Middlewares 
the request is first received by the middleware . This middleware will perform some processes on the request to authenticate the validity of the
request and then will pass on this request to the desired function . If the middleware finds something suspicious , it will return the request from 
there only without routing it to the desired function .

Middleware can also make changes to the request /response 

We create handler function for the middleware which contain req, res, and next as parameters.

If i go from 1 middleware to another i will be having the acess of every varaible/constant declares in the previous middlewares with the help
of which i can make changes in the response and the request
